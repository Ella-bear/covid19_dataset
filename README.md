# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project provides a step-by-step guide to analyzing, visualizing, and reporting on global COVID-19 data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Learners will clean real-world datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and communicate key insights.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts, maps, and tables
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Download the latest [Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) (owid-covid-data.csv) and save it in your project folder.

2. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Load the dataset with pandas and explore its structure, columns, and missing values.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   Filter countries of interest, handle missing values, and convert columns to appropriate types.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Generate descriptive statistics and visualize trends such as total cases, deaths, and daily changes.

5. **Vaccination Progress**  
   Analyze and visualize vaccination rollouts and compare between countries.

6. **Optional: Choropleth Map**  
   Visualize case or vaccination rates on a world map using Plotly Express or geopandas.

7. **Insights & Reporting**  
   Summarize findings and write key insights in markdown cells.

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional)
- geopandas (optional)

## Deliverables

- Well-documented Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and narrative insights
- (Optional) Exported report as PDF or PowerPoint
